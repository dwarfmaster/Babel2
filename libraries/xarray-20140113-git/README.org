* Using this file

  This README file is intended to be read by humans as well as
  processed by Emacs org-mode for publishing, for literate-programming
  of examples, for bug-tracking and task/issue management, etc.

** TODO [#A] Write up basic setup for using this file from org-mode
   - State "TODO"       from ""           [2010-06-07 Mon 16:18]

   leveraging ORG-MODE tools for mixing in TODO's within docs -- need
   to include incantation for this to do the right thing for the
   agenda view!

   Right now there are issues with common-lisp support from within
   babel within org-mode. The configuration is not clear right out of
   the box and requires a bit of work to get working.

* Overview

  This package implements a generalized interface for array-like
  objects.  An array-like object is any structure whose data (but not
  necessarily metadata) could be simply mappable to either a lisp
  array or a list-of-list structure.

  This could be interpreted in that this forms either a rectangular or
  ragged-array (differential lengths of EITHER rows OR columns).  

  The idea is that we should be able to index an object's data, but
  might not be able to access specialized metadata.  We provide a
  means of having views into convienently indexable rectangular
  substructures, which are view-by-reference, not copies, (TODO: need
  to create indexing tools for pulling various combinations out).  In
  addition, there is a tool for taking a copy of the array into a lisp
  array (TODO: generalize to other array structures).

  General design is that xref works out of the box on lisp arrays and
  list-of-list structures.  Additional matrix packages could depend on
  xarray and extend the generics (i.e. lisp-matrix) or have
  patching-packages (think ASDF-SYSTEM-CONNECTIONS) register.

  In a sense, we just rely on the default situation of CLOS -- it'll
  tell users which structures need xref-able methods, and the users
  will just have to tell us.  But that means that XARRAY is their
  dependency, not that an XARRAY can look forward and load them (which
  might be worthwhile when using XCREATE or the conversion routines.

** Core
*** XREF

   Access individual elements in an array.

#+begin_src lisp
  (xref object
        #| 1 2 3 or similar indexing sequence |# )
  (setf (xref object
              #| 1 2 3 or similar indexing sequence |# )
        value)
#+end_src

  to retrieve or set an element.  This would be easy to do with aref
  if aref was a generic function, but for various (sensible) reasons,
  it is not.  I (here, this is Tamas) describe a simple interface with
  a few generic functions.  Any objects that has these methods is
  called "xrefable".  For a given datastructure, we must implement the
  following tools.

  queries (sub)structure and returns views which can be accessed and
  set.  The reference <ref> manages the indicies in the resulting
  view.

#+begin_src lisp
  (xref object <ref>)
#+end_src

*** XDIMS
   queries dimensions of structure.  There is an open question[fn:1]
   whether an XDIM function should exist.

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (xdims object)  ;; returns list of all indicies
  (xdim object <dimindex eg 0, ..., n-1>)
  (nth 0 (xdims object))
  (nth 1 (xdims object))
#+end_src

*** XELTTYPE

#+begin_src lisp
   (xelttype object &optional <ref>)
#+end_src

   queries element and substructure types.  If <ref> is given, it
   returns the substructure, if <ref> is nil, it returns the whole
   structure.

*** XCOPY

#+begin_src lisp
   (xcopy object <ref>)
#+end_src

   queries (sub)structure and returns copies.  If one gets confused
   between a view and copy, dire consequences could entail, so we use
   separate generic functions for reference and copy, rather than a
   single "xaccess", which could result in:

#+begin_src common-lisp
   (defmacro xref  (&rest args) (xaccess :type 'reference @args))
   (defmacro xcopy (&rest args) (xaccess :type 'copy      @args))
#+end_src

*** XNEW

   creates a new structure.  One could consider using a undefined
   object in order to implement this with setf, i.e. 

#+begin_src common-lisp
   (setf (xref undef-object <refs>) object-with-right-structure)
#+end_src
   and having it return undef-object with the right value.  But there
   are a few other possibilities.

** Extended
*** XRANK
*** XSIMILAR
*** XSIZE
    Return the number of elements in the array (product of dimensions,
    so a zero-dimensional array has size 1).  Should be the analog of
    ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE

*** XCREATE
    Creates a new xref-able object with a particular backing store
    (ARRAY, or LISTOFLIST, or MATRIX-LIKE, or DATAFRAME-LIKE).

*** AS*
    libraries specialize, so write for data store.

    Users should leverage AS or COPY-AS

*** AS
    user function for as*

*** COPY-AS
    user function for as* which makes a deep copy

*** TAKE
    
** Utility
   these are currently related to arrays.
*** CVECTOR
    returns a simple array of the specified element type, which is
    vector-ish, filled by contents.

*** CARRAY
    returns a simple array of the specified element type, which is
    array-ish (dimensioned), filled by contents.

*** CVECTOR*
    Same as cvector, but element-type is derived using NUMERIC-TYPE-CLASSIFIER. 

*** CARRAY*
    Same as carray, but element-type is derived using NUMERIC-TYPE-CLASSIFIER. 

* Approach in general

  Both copies and views on an array should be XREF-able.  

  Array and vector construction for LISP ARRAYS (the default and base storage class) are shown as follows: 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defparameter *b* (xarray:cvector* (list 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0)))
  ,*b* ;; this is an array of 1 item, a list of 8 floats
  
  (defparameter *c* (xarray:cvector* 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0))
  ,*c* ;; this is an array of 8 items, each a float
  
  (defparameter *a* (xarray:carray* (list 2 4)
                                    0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0))
  ,*a*
  
  
  
  (defparameter *d* (xarray:cvector 'double-float 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0))
  ,*d* ;; this is an array of 1 item, a list of 8 floats
  
  (defparameter *e* (xarray:cvector 'fixnum 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
  ,*e* ;; this is an array of 8 items, each a float
  
  (defparameter *f* (xarray:carray 'fixnum (list 2 4)
                                    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
  ,*f*
  
  (defparameter *g* (xarray:carray 'double-float (list 2 4)
                                    0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0))
  *g*
#+END_SRC

  This can be sliced and dices in a number of ways, 

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (xarray:xslice *a* :all 2)  ; third column
  (xarray:xslice *a* 0 :all) ; first row
#+end_src

  selects the 3th column of an array.[fn:2] , and then the first row.
  This view is also xrefable, so you can use

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (setf (xarray:xref (xarray:xslice *a* :all 2) 1) 9.0)
#+end_src

  to set element 2 in the 3rd column, which has value 6, to the
  value 9.  Changes will be made in the original array

#+begin_src common-lisp
  *a*
#+end_src

  since this is a view.  But for functions that just expect an array,
  they can use the interface (xref, xdims, etc) and not care where it
  is coming from.

  I have also implemented permutations (generalized transpose), and
  row-major projections.  If you want to collect the elements of a
  view in an array ("deep copy"), use

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (copy-as *a*)
  (copy-as (xarray:xslice *a* :all 2))
#+end_src

  which delivers a CL array of the original and then sliced xrefable object.  

  There are convenience functions that for easy array/vector creation,
  inspired by R:

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (carray* '(2 3) 1 2 3 4d0 5 6)
  ;; => #2A((1.0d0 2.0d0 3.0d0) (4.0d0 5.0d0 6.0d0))
#+end_src

  guess the type so that all of the elements would fit in.  See also
  cvector and carray (manually specified type) and cvector*.

  Tamas was thinking about this being a general interface, but then in
  my (Tony's) opinion, included some specialized issues that needed to
  be considered here but handled elsewhere.  My limited understanding
  had to do with practical considerations; I don't need to be
  practical, and he does.  THIS is precisely where I am deviating in
  my further development of this.

  What I (Tony) am currently thinking about is to pay a penalty
  initially (and maybe for a while!) on speed of access and write a
  general interface using a range of possible back-ends.  So that we
  can get the interface clean: xref pulls out a value and puts it int
  an array of the same structure, xref* pulls out a value and sticks
  it into a lisp array or scalar and returns it.  Speed can be handled
  later by doing a compile-time/run-time tradeoff, we will pay the
  compile-time penalty, in exchange for run-time advantages.  This
  fits into the theme of rapid prototyping (slow exec) followed by
  rapid execution (post-proto...).

  We'll optimize for version 2.  Ha-ha.

  Current thinking on the above, is to stick them into separate
  packages.  In particular, I've factored out the listoflist
  infrastructure into its own package.

  Checking current test state; but this is currently broken!

* Discussion

* Footnotes

[fn:1] this is aesthetic.  Why write a simple list extract tool when
it could suffice to use existing list extraction functions?  This also
leads to better programmer knowledge, as well as a single point of
optimization for the overall system (the internal system list
manipulation functions)

[fn:2] The slice interface is similar to Tamas' affi package, but now
arbitrary index vectors are allowed, much like R.
